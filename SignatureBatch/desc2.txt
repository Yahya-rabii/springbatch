i'm about to develop a spring batch app,
this app will be automatically triggered twice a day
this spring batch will do the next TASKS : we will get all the operations signed


from the gateway using the next endpoint : localhost:9000/getSignedOperations
the gateway's answer will be like this
  [
    {
      "operationId": 12121212,
      "documents": [{
        "name": "doc-name.pdf",
        "idGw" : "XXXXXXX"
      },
        {
          "name": "doc-name2.pdf",
          "idGw" : "XXXXXXX"
        }]
    },
    {
      "operationId": 12121213,
      "documents": [{
        "name": "doc-name.pdf",
        "idGw" : "XXXXXXX"
      },
        {
          "name": "doc-name2.pdf",
          "idGw" : "XXXXXXX"
        }]
    }
  ]
within the same batch (in the created table in the database that contains these columns : documentId , documentName , PdfArProofStatus ,PdfFrProofStatus , XmlProofStatus , PdfArGedId ,PdfFrGedId , XmlGedId )
using each operation id get the proofs (each document has 3 proofs one pdf file in arabic one pdf file in french and one xml file)
of its document using the next endpoint in case the format is pdf and the language = ar/fr
http://localhost:9000/documents/proofs?operationId=%d&format=%s&language=%s
and the following in case the format is xml
http://localhost:9000/documents/proofs?operationId=%d&format=%s
for each operation send 3 requests to the previous end points one to get all pdf ar proofs of operation second to get all pdf fr proofs and third to get all xml proofs
the response will be the base 64 of the docs ... after getting all proofs save them to the database (GED) and get the ids of the saved proofs base 64 docs and then update the table with the ids of the proofs base 64 saved in the ged
